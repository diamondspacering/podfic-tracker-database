- Back up your data
- Create new tables and fields, update functions, etc.
- Manually make sure everything is marked as posted_unchaptered that should be - it's possible this is inaccurate
  - The new view (commented out bc it's annoying later) helps w/ this
- Run the code to update podfic section types, or rerun the code to set multiple-to-single after correcting posted_unchaptered if you already did it
- Delete old functions & triggers
- Run the code to create default & multiple-to-single podfic sections
- Back up your data again just in case
- Run the code to remove old fields and delete old tables
- Check that everything looks ok
  - `SELECT resource_id from resource_chapter WHERE resource_id not in (select resource_id from resource_section);`
- Consider finagling to reset things so fields are in a "better" order but like who cares organizing the data is difficult
