- [x] Migrate data
  - [x] Create new tables
  - [x] Add fields to existing tables
  - [x] Create sections for existing podfics
    - [x] Regular podfics
    - [x] Regular chaptered podfics
    - [x] Chapters posted all in one
      - NOTE: not all are properely marked as posted_unchaptered, manually check some & clean up data as needed
        - create utility for deleting chapter sections?
      - consider manually marking these first
    - [x] Multivoices (one section for each part atm)
  - [x] Functions
    - don't need to explicitly remove triggers, just remove from the DDL anything that doesn't need to be created (so do a migration, remove triggers & functions, then regenerate DDL...?)
      - so maybe do in migration
    - [x] `update_all_raw_lengths_from_recording_sessions`
    - [x] `update_podfic_length_from_sections` (and trigger) to replace:
      - `update_length_from_parts`
      - `update_podfic_length_from_chapters`
      - check functionality of both!
    - [x] `update_plain_length_from_file`
      - make sure master plain length also updates from this - this should update sections
    - [x] `update_raw_length_from_recording_session`
    - [x] `update_recording_session_length`
  - [x] Add section triggers
  - [x] Make sure all dependent records are updated to be linked to appropriate sections
    - mostly do this when creating sections? esp chapter sections? manually do some podfic ones?
    - ok this isn't working correctly
  - [x] Update & add functions as necessary for automatic DB updates
  - [x] Data to check that it's updated correctly:
    - Every resource in `resource_chapter` should have a resource in `resource_section`
  - [x] [FINAL STEP] Delete unnecessary DB fields & make fields mandatory as necessary
    - may need extra work to let it do that
  - [x] [FINAL STEP] Delete unnecessary DB tables as well
- [ ] Figure out how to handle podfic posting dates :sob:
- [ ] Update routes & loaders
  - [x] New section routes?
  - [ ] Make sure all previous routes are fetching/asking for correct information structured correctly
  - [ ] Make sure all code is calling routes correctly and getting correct types/info
- [ ] Tables
  - [x] Chapter tables
    - check all variations, etc. chapter combined can wait till later I'm ignoring it
    - make everything as reusable as possible w/ columns, etc.
  - [x] Parts table
  - [x] Podfic table
    - [x] make sure sections update properly, can update inline appropriately, etc.
  - [ ] Smaller resources/content tables
- [x] Test all types of podfic
- [x] Figure out what's going on w/ section status
  - Lowkey maybe sections should have status but NOT chapters. Chapters should be. like. vestigial atp.
  - Like if you have chapters_split then you kinda want to be able to track where you're at in them!
    - but then top level chapters do you wanna know...no you don't. idiot.
  - then just a completesChapter flag in recording sessions that shows different text if it's chapter/section/part
- [ ] Length color scale not working on chapter tables
- [x] Chapter tables freezing
  - ok so podfic table is fine everythings just evil
  - yeah it was the classic reference value default value rerendering infinitely
- [x] part form
- [x] adding recording session to chapter doesn't seem to. work. does it not update properly...?
- [ ] fix schedule
- [ ] babe ur stats page,,,
